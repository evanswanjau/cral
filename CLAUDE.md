# Cruz Ride Auto (CRAL)

Car-rental marketplace for Kenya. Three portals — customer, merchant, admin
(Ops) — over one HTTP API. Solo-built. Source of truth for scope and
sequencing is `/openapi` (frozen contracts) and the platform API spec /
delivery plan the owner has on hand; this file is the persistent stack and
convention reference so it doesn't need re-explaining every session.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Foundation.** Nothing customer-facing yet. Do not start Phase 1
(accounts & login) work unless explicitly asked.

## Stack

- Monorepo, npm workspaces (no Turborepo/Nx). Node 22 LTS, npm.
- Backend — `apps/api`: Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL via Knex (query
  builder + migrations, not a full ORM), Zod for validation, Redis + BullMQ
  for background jobs, Vitest + Supertest for tests.
- Frontend — `apps/customer`, `apps/merchant`, `apps/admin`: separate Vite +
  React + TypeScript apps, each with its own Tailwind config (not a shared
  meta-framework). TanStack Query for data fetching, React Router, React
  Hook Form.
- Shared — `packages/ui` (design tokens, status badges, plated references,
  buttons, state screens) and `packages/types` (shared TS types + Zod
  schemas: IDs, money, error envelope, pagination).
- `/openapi`: one file per domain, frozen before that domain is built
  (contract-first, vertical slices — see the delivery plan's ritual).

## Non-negotiable conventions (spec §2)

- **IDs**: prefixed ULIDs, never auto-increment integers. Prefixes live in
  `packages/types/src/ids.ts` (`usr_`, `mer_`, `veh_`, `bkg_`, `hnd_`,
  `pay_`, `dep_`, `pot_`, `inv_`, `dsp_`, `rev_`, `fil_`, `cmp_`, `doc_`,
  plus internal `aud_` for audit rows). Generate with
  `apps/api/src/lib/ids.ts#generateId` — never let Postgres generate a PK.
- **Money**: always `{ amount: <integer cents>, currency: "KES" }`, never a
  float. DB columns follow the `<name>_amount` (integer) / `<name>_currency`
  (char(3)) pair via `apps/api/src/db/schema-helpers.ts#addMoneyColumn`.
  Display formatting is a client concern, never the API's.
- **Errors**: one envelope shape everywhere — `{ error: { type, code,
  message, field?, doc_url?, request_id } }`. Thrown as `ApiError` from
  `@cral/types`, rendered by `apps/api/src/middleware/error-handler.ts`.
- **Pagination**: cursor-based only, via `apps/api/src/lib/pagination.ts`.
  No offset paging, anywhere — queues change under the reader.
- **Idempotency**: every POST that moves money or completes a handover
  requires an `Idempotency-Key` header and must replay safely within 24h.
  Enforced by `apps/api/src/middleware/idempotency.ts`, backed by the
  `idempotency_keys` table. Mount per-route, not globally.
- **Audit log**: every admin/state-changing action writes a row to
  `audit_log` in the *same transaction* as the change, never as a follow-up
  step. The table is append-only at the DB level (`REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE`).
- **Time**: stored and transmitted as UTC (RFC 3339). Nairobi time only for
  display and day-boundary pricing logic — never stored.
- **Every table**: prefixed-ULID PK, `created_at`/`updated_at` (timestamptz,
  UTC) via `addTimestamps`. Use `apps/api/src/db/schema-helpers.ts` in every
  migration rather than re-deriving these column patterns.

## Adapters (Phase 0 groundwork)

SMS, email and file storage are behind interfaces in
`apps/api/src/adapters/{sms,email,storage}` so a real provider drops in
later without touching call sites. Dev/test default is a console/local-disk
adapter — no SMS or email ever leaves the building until a real adapter is
wired in and selected via `SMS_ADAPTER` / `EMAIL_ADAPTER` /
`STORAGE_ADAPTER` env vars.

## Design tokens

`packages/ui/src/tokens.ts` currently holds **placeholder values** — swap
them for the real exported design values (colors, the five-state badge
tones, the plated/monospace reference styling, the "boosted" skew) when
available. The shape shouldn't need to change, only the values.

## What NOT to do

- Don't add a fourth portal, a meta-framework, or a shared frontend
  framework across the three apps — they're deliberately separate Vite apps.
- Don't introduce floats for money, auto-increment PKs, or offset pagination
  anywhere, including in throwaway/demo code.
- Don't build ahead of the current phase (see delivery plan's phase-by-phase
  sequencing and the "sequencing traps" section) unless explicitly asked.
- Don't wire a real SMS/email/storage provider without being asked — the
  console/local adapters are intentional for now.

## Local dev

```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run dev:api        # http://localhost:4000
npm run dev:customer   # http://localhost:5173
npm run dev:merchant   # http://localhost:5174
npm run dev:admin      # http://localhost:5175
npm run dev -w packages/ui   # component preview, http://localhost:5180
```
